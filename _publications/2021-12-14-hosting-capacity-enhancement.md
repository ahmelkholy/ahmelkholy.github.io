This paper presents an IoT-based hosting capacity enhancement technique by active power curtailment of the power generated from PV systems at prosumers. The system was modeled and simulated using MATLAB/SimulinkÂ® software package and the results validate the effectiveness of this enhancement technique in keeping overvoltage levels below limits.
