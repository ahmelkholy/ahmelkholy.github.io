excerpt: 'This paper presents a method for designing the ratings of a unified power flow controller (UPC), a device that can control and balance the active and reactive power flows through a three-phase transmission line by injecting current using a variable coefficient transformer. The determination of the UPC rating depends on the load profile of the unbalanced distribution system, and the rating of the UPC depends on their use as active and reactive power balancer or as active power balancer and reactive power compensator. The procedure is applied to a standard 13-bus IEEE unbalanced distribution system with different load scenarios to evaluate UPC performance in each case.'

## Paper Info

This paper introduces a method for determining the ratings of a Unified Power Controller (UPC), a device designed to balance active and reactive power flows in unbalanced distribution systems. The method considers the load profile of the distribution system and the intended use of the UPC, whether as an active and reactive power balancer or as an active power balancer and reactive power compensator. The approach is applied to a standard 13-bus IEEE unbalanced distribution system under various load scenarios to assess the performance of the UPC in each case.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for designing the ratings of a unified power flow controller (UPC), a device that can control and balance the active and reactive power flows through a three-phase transmission line by injecting current using a variable coefficient transformer. The determination of the UPC rating depends on the load profile of the unbalanced distribution system, also the rating of the UPC depends on their use as active and reactive power balancer or as active power balancer and reactive power compensator. The procedure is applied to a standard 13-bus IEEE unbalanced distribution system with different load scenarios to evaluate UPC performance in each case. This provides a systematic approach for selecting appropriate UPC ratings to enhance power quality and reliability in an unbalanced distribution system.
