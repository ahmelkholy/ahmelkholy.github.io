## Abstract

This paper presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of a novel 50 kvar Static Var Compensator (SVC) integrated with an Internet of Things (IoT) controller for a low-voltage power distribution system in Moscow. This integration enhances real-time monitoring and control capabilities over traditional SVC systems. The study focuses on advanced control systems for reactive power compensation, voltage stabilization, and overall system efficiency. Data collected over two months demonstrate the SVC's effectiveness in maintaining a stable power factor close to unity and reducing reactive power demand. The device successfully kept voltage levels within acceptable limits across all phases, reducing fluctuations and ensuring balanced voltage levels. Key findings include enhanced reactive power compensation, voltage stabilization (minimum voltage not less than 218 V), improved system efficiency (reactive power demand from the source near zero most of the time), and significant improvements in power quality and grid stability. The case study at Kosinskaya Street, Moscow, confirms the device's role in improving power quality and grid stability. These results support the broader deployment of IoT-integrated SVC technology in low-voltage power distribution systems.
