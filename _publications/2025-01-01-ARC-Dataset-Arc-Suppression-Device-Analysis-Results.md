## Abstract

ARC Dataset: Arc Suppression Device Analysis Results ## Description This dataset contains MATLAB simulation results supporting research on Arc Suppression Device (ASD) technology for mitigating single line-to-ground faults in power systems. The data encompasses four test scenarios analyzing fault current reduction, overvoltage mitigation, and voltage restoration improvements. ## Research Highlights - 97.8% reduction in fault current (from 2000A to 45A)- Overvoltage reduction from 1.5 p.u. to 1.1 p.u.- 92.9% improvement in voltage restoration time- Enhanced power system resilience during faults ## Dataset Contents The dataset includes simulation results from a four-bus system implementation, with varying time intervals and parameter configurations. Data supports both theoretical analysis and practical implementation of ASD technology. ## Usage These files can be loaded in MATLAB for analysis and visualization of the simulation results. The data corresponds to the case study and results sections of the associated research paper. ## Associated Paper This dataset supports the research paper "Arc Suppression Device Technology" which presents comprehensive analysis of ASD implementation for power systems. ## Citation If you use this dataset, please cite:[Add citation information] ## License [Specify license] ## Contact [Add contact information] ## Keywords - Simulation Data- MATLAB Analysis- Parameter Sweep
