## Abstract

This paper proposes an effective algorithm; this algorithm is updating the phase-locked loop (PLL) gains according to the value of the short circuit ratio that will decrease the weak grid effect in the PLL controllers to reduce problems related to renewable energy sources and connect to the point of common coupling (PCC). Based on system parameters estimation, the proposed algorithm enhances the system stability for the distribution networks. The standard IEEE 33-bus test system is used to investigate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness and superiority. An extensive mathematical effort is exerted to get the system's small-signal stability (SSS) model. The tuning of the phase-locked loop and the current control loop are choosing to dynamically change according to the system variables to ensure the same system stability margin, whatever the change in the loading conditions. The MATLAB/Simulink model is used to validate the algorithm and simulate the test system.
