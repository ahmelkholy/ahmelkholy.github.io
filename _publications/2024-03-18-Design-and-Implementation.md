## Paper Info

This paper introduces a novel arc suppression device designed to mitigate the risks associated with hazardous arcs in power systems, particularly those caused by shunt faults. The device operates by injecting voltage into the neutral line path, a strategy that not only reduces arc currents during fault conditions but also prevents system isolation. The paper provides a comprehensive review of existing arc suppression methods, including both passive and active technologies, and discusses their limitations. It then delves into the design considerations for the proposed device, focusing on aspects such as neutral path selection and voltage injection method. The effectiveness of the device is evaluated through simulations conducted using MATLAB Simulink, revealing that the addition of a device capable of injecting a zero sequence component significantly limits the fault current in the faulty phase. Importantly, the voltage at the load terminal remains unaffected by the device's addition, making it a low-cost and advantageous alternative to active arc suppression devices. The paper also explores how changing the open delta polarity or transformer ratio does not impact the fault current and discusses practical implementation issues, including cost and compatibility with existing power system components.
