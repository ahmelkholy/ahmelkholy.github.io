## Key points covered in the article:

### Background and Motivation:

The paper discusses the growing energy consumption, new energy sources, and varying load schedules that demand higher electrical energy quality and reduced energy losses. As power consumption approaches the capacity of power lines and load unbalance increases, negative impacts on energy quality and efficiency are observed, particularly in distribution networks due to their length and load-dependence.

## Challenges and Solutions:

Unbalanced modes of operation can lead to technical and economic problems like relay protection issues and deviations in power quality. Converter technology tools like reactive-power compensation devices or balancing devices are required to mitigate these issues. The paper highlights the need for means to assess and address load asymmetry effects.

## Methodology:

The research uses the UDSLF program, which calculates unbalanced modes of operation using the Newton-Raphson method. The paper also discusses the calculation of energy losses and voltage quality based on unbalanced operation results.

## Case Study:

The IEEE four-bus test system is used as a case study to analyze the impact of unbalanced loads on power transmission line operation. The paper presents the load parameters, transmission line data, and transformer parameters used for analysis.

## Research Results:

The paper presents results of the analysis, including dependencies between negative-sequence voltage-unbalance coefficients, energy losses, and energy transfer efficiency on factors like load asymmetry, transmission line parameters, and load factors.

## Universal Power Controller:

The paper proposes a universal power controller (UPC) that uses measured currents and voltages to determine control actions for mitigating load asymmetry effects.
