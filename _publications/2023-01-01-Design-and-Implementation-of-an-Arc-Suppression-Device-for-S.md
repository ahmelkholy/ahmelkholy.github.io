## Abstract

This paper proposes an arc suppression device to address hazardous arcs caused by shunt faults in power systems. The device injects voltage into the neutral line path, reducing arc currents during fault conditions and preventing system isolation. Existing methods for arc suppression are reviewed, including passive and active technologies, with their limitations discussed. The paper presents design considerations for the proposed device, such as neutral path selection and voltage injection method, and evaluates its effectiveness through simulations conducted using MATLAB Simulink. The results show that the addition of a device that injects zero sequence component significantly limits the fault current in the faulty phase. The voltage at the load terminal is not affected by the addition of the device. The device is a low-cost and advantageous alternative to active arc suppression devices, combining the benefits of passive and active devices while avoiding their negative effects. Additionally, changing the open delta polarity or transformer ratio does not affect the fault current. Practical implementation issues, such as cost and compatibility with existing power system components, are also discussed.
