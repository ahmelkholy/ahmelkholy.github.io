This paper proposes an effective algorithm for updating the phase-locked loop (PLL) gains according to the value of the short circuit ratio to decrease the weak grid effect in the PLL controllers. The proposed algorithm enhances system stability for distribution networks based on system parameters estimation. The standard IEEE 33-bus test system is used to investigate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm. An extensive mathematical effort is exerted to get the systemâ€™s small-signal stability (SSS) model. The tuning of the phase-locked loop and current control loop are chosen to dynamically change according to system variables to ensure the same system stability margin, whatever the change in loading conditions. The MATLAB/Simulink model is used to validate the algorithm and simulate the test system.
