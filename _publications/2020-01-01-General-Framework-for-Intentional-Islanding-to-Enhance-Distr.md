## Abstract

Due to the increase of load demand, the utility tends to utilize DG technology in recent years. The intentional islanding is an appropriate approach to enhance system performance such as reliability and operational flexibility. This research provides a new paradigm for intentional islanding to maximize the efficiency of the power system. The methodology is based on an advanced load shedding algorithm to achieve a load generation balance and control strategy to ensure a smooth transition from normal mode to island mode with high load power quality. Moreover, it is suggested to assess the small-signal stability of new islands to evaluate their performance and give priority among different alternatives. IEEE 33-bus system is taken as a case study to ensure the effectiveness of the introduced methodology. The analysis is performed for a case study with optimal DG locations and sizes. NEPLAN software is used for dynamics and smallsignal stability investigations.
