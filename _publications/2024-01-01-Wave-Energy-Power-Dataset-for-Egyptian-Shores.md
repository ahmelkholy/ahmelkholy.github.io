## Abstract

This repository contains a dataset representing wave energy along the Egyptian shores. The data is intended for use with the [WEC-Sim](https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/main/index.html) package, a wave energy converter simulation tool. Included in this repository is a PowerShell script for compressing and decompressing the data. This script is designed to work on Windows. If you're using a different operating system, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
