This paper introduces a methodology for performing intentional islanding with maximum possible benefits for distribution systems. The methodology is based on an advanced load shedding algorithm to achieve load generation balance and apply a control strategy to ensure a smooth transition from normal mode to island mode with high load power quality. The analysis is performed for a case study with optimal DG locations and sizes using NEPLAN software for dynamics and small signal stability investigations.
