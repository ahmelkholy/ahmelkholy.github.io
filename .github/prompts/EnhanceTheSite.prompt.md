this is my site i host it at github pages,

i have buld it based on the jekell theme "minimal-mistakes"

but i did not do all the things needed to make it a good site
this include google adds, analytics, sitemap, robots.txt, etc
and also this site is not indexed by google that means it is not discoverable by people searching for it

i will give you the links of my profile to use it to enhance the site

i am uses this site to write an article in arabic language make it also freindly to arabic language as it and enhance it

"this is readme file in github i want to use the infromation in it

abstract = {This study introduces a new methodology for performing intentional islanding with maximum possible benefits for distribution systems. The methodology is based on an advanced load shedding algorithm to achieve load generation balance and apply a control strategy to ensure a smooth transition from normal mode to island mode with high load power quality. Generally, the load shedding algorithm is applied to improve the reliability by serving maximum number of customers. Investigation of the dynamic behavior of the distribution network during transition due to intentional islanding is a main concern in this thesis. When operating in the island mode, the local supervisory control system can modify the generator frequency controller and voltage controller to guarantee high power quality for the new isolated system. In addition, it is suggested to assess the small signal stability of new islands to evaluate their performance and give priority among different alternatives. Small signal stability study is introduced for each island to check the stability for the new islands. IEEE 33-bus system is taken as a case study to ensure the effectiveness of the introduced methodology. The analysis is performed for a case study with optimal DG locations and sizes. NEPLAN software is used for dynamics and small signal stability investigations.},

The standard IEEE 33-bus test system is used to investigate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness and superiority. An extensive mathematical effort is exerted to get the system's small-signal stability (SSS) model. The tuning of the phase-locked loop and the current control loop are choosing to dynamically change according to the system variables to ensure the same system stability margin, whatever the change in the loading conditions. The MATLAB/Simulink model is used to validate the algorithm and simulate the test system.},

Each suggested device's operating principle is developed in this paper in order to provide the best model to be used in the power flow analysis. The performance of the IEEE-13 bus imbalanced distribution model is investigated using the Newton-Raphson method. To improve network asymmetry, an optimization analysis is carried out to ascertain how each proposed device will work. In this paper, the mode of operation of each device is determined every hour to flow the changing in loads according to their daily load curve. The genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to determine the contribution of the unified flow controller to balance the loads between phases. The multi-objective function is constructed to combine the total system losses and the average voltage unbalance coefficient. The paper provides an optimal dynamic technique to optimally operate the unified power flow controller installed in the unbalanced three-phase distribution system.},

The device injects voltage into the neutral line path, reducing arc currents during fault conditions and preventing system isolation. Existing methods for arc suppression are reviewed, including passive and active technologies, with their limitations discussed. The paper presents design considerations for the proposed device, such as neutral path selection and voltage injection method, and evaluates its effectiveness through simulations conducted using MATLAB Simulink. The results show that the addition of a device that injects zero sequence component significantly limits the fault current in the faulty phase. The voltage at the load terminal is not affected by the addition of the device. The device is a low-cost and advantageous alternative to active arc suppression devices, combining the benefits of passive and active devices while avoiding their negative effects. Additionally, changing the open delta polarity or transformer ratio does not affect the fault current. Practical implementation issues, such as cost and compatibility with existing power system components, are also discussed.},

This integration enhances real-time monitoring and control capabilities over traditional SVC systems. The study focuses on advanced control systems for reactive power compensation, voltage stabilization, and overall system efficiency. Data collected over two months demonstrate the SVC's effectiveness in maintaining a stable power factor close to unity and reducing reactive power demand. The device successfully kept voltage levels within acceptable limits across all phases, reducing fluctuations and ensuring balanced voltage levels. Key findings include enhanced reactive power compensation, voltage stabilization (minimum voltage not less than 218 V), improved system efficiency (reactive power demand from the source near zero most of the time), and significant improvements in power quality and grid stability. The case study at Kosinskaya Street, Moscow, confirms the device's role in improving power quality and grid stability. These results support the broader deployment of IoT-integrated SVC technology in low-voltage power distribution systems.},

abstract = {Due to the high cost of installing large thermal power plants and the resulting emissions from such plants, consumers were encouraged to install rooftop photovoltaic systems. Yet, challenges of integrating solar power into the distribution networks are restraining the amount of allowed generation from rooftop PV systems. Grid operators (GO) started to even limit rooftop PV systems installation capacity toa maximum of their respective load peak value. This paper presents an IoT-based hosting capacity enhancement techniqueby active power curtailment of the power generated from the PV systems at prosumers. Where the IoT establishes a communication channel between the Grid Operator (GO) and all prosumers using the Internet-of-Asset (IoA) architecture. Measurement signals of the Low Voltage (LV) network, solar irradiation, and temperature are necessary for the control technique to generate the reference control voltage for the solar inverter to produce the curtailed PV generation. Theeffect of load and irradiation variation is studied in the presence of the MPPT control, and the GO control, this term isused to describe GO's signal to curtail PV generation. The system has been modeled and simulated via the MATLAB/Simulink\textregistered{} software package. The results validate the effectiveness of this enhancement technique in keeping the overvoltage levels below limits.},
