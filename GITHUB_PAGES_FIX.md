# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem

The GitHub Pages deployment was failing with a Ruby setup error because the workflow was using a pinned version of the ruby/setup-ruby action that doesn't work well with GitHub Codespaces (detected as self-hosted runners).

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Main Workflow (jekyll.yml)

- Changed from pinned SHA to `ruby/setup-ruby@v1`
- This version handles different runner environments better

### 2. Added .ruby-version File

- Specifies Ruby 3.1.4 for consistent builds
- GitHub Actions will automatically use this version

### 3. Alternative Workflows Created

#### Option A: pages-deploy.yml

- More explicit dependency management
- Better error handling
- Manual bundle configuration

#### Option B: github-pages.yml

- Uses official `actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1`
- Simplest and most reliable approach
- Recommended for most cases

## Recommended Action

1. **Push these changes to your repository:**

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Choose one workflow approach:**

   - Keep the updated `jekyll.yml` (minimal changes)
   - OR switch to `github-pages.yml` (most reliable)
   - OR use `pages-deploy.yml` (most control)

3. **If switching workflows:**
   - Disable the old workflow in GitHub Actions tab
   - Rename your preferred workflow to replace jekyll.yml

## Testing the Fix

After pushing:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Trigger a new deployment (push a commit or manual trigger)
4. The build should now succeed

## Fallback Options

If issues persist:

1. Use GitHub's built-in Jekyll Pages (no custom workflow needed)
2. Build locally and push to gh-pages branch
3. Use GitHub Codespaces for development only, not deployment

## Notes

- The original error occurred because Codespaces are detected as "self-hosted" runners
- Standard GitHub-hosted runners (ubuntu-latest) work fine with the updated workflow
- All your site enhancements (SEO, Arabic support, etc.) are preserved
