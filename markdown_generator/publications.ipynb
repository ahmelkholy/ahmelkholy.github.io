      "2021\tHosting Capacity Enhancement Through IoT-based Active Power Curtailment of PV Generation\t2021 22nd International Middle East Power Systems Conference (MEPCON)\tDue to the high cost of installing large thermal power plants and the resulting emissions from such plants, consumers were encouraged to install rooftop photovoltaic systems. Yet, challenges of integrating solar power into the distribution networks are restraining the amount of allowed generation from rooftop PV systems. Grid operators (GO) started to even limit rooftop PV systems installation capacity toa maximum of their respective load peak value. This paper presents an IoT-based hosting capacity enhancement techniqueby active power curtailment of the power generated from the PV systems at prosumers. Where the IoT establishes a communication channel between the Grid Operator (GO) and all prosumers using the Internet-of-Asset (IoA) architecture. Measurement signals of the Low Voltage (LV) network, solar irradiation, and temperature are necessary for the control technique to generate the reference control voltage for the solar inverter to produce the curtailed PV generation. Theeffect of load and irradiation variation is studied in the presence of the MPPT control, and the GO control, this term isused to describe GO's signal to curtail PV generation. The system has been modeled and simulated via the MATLAB/Simulink® software package. The results validate the effectiveness of this enhancement technique in keeping the overvoltage levels below limits.\t10.1109/MEPCON50283.2021.9686240\thttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9686240/\thttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9686240/\n",

      "2022\tGrid Synchronization Enhancement of Distributed Generators Using an Adaptive Phase-Locked Loop Tuning System\tElectronics\tThis paper proposes an effective algorithm; this algorithm is updating the phase-locked loop (PLL) gains according to the value of the short circuit ratio that will decrease the weak grid effect in the PLL controllers to reduce problems related to renewable energy sources and connect to the point of common coupling (PCC). Based on system parameters estimation, the proposed algorithm enhances the system stability for the distribution networks. The standard IEEE 33-bus test system is used to investigate the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness and superiority. An extensive mathematical effort is exerted to get the system’s small-signal stability (SSS) model. The tuning of the phase-locked loop and the current control loop are choosing to dynamically change according to the system variables to ensure the same system stability margin, whatever the change in the loading conditions. The MATLAB/Simulink model is used to validate the algorithm and simulate the test system.\t10.3390/electronics11050702\t\t\n",

      "2020\tISLANDING SCENARIOS FOR HIGH RELIABLE OPERATION OF DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS\t\tIslanding is considered important problem that faces distributed generation. This problem occurs when the protection system takes a correct action to disconnect the fault as a result of that new isolated system is formed. This study introduces a methodology for performing intentional islanding with maximum possible benefits for distribution systems. The methodology is based on an advanced load shedding algorithm to achieve load generation balance and apply a control strategy to ensure a smooth transition from normal mode to island mode with high load power quality. Generally, the load shedding algorithm is applied to improve the reliability by serving maximum number of customers. Investigation of the dynamic behavior of the distribution network during transition due to intentional islanding is a main concern in this thesis. When operating in the island mode, the local supervisory control system can modify the generator frequency controller and voltage controller to guarantee high power quality for the new isolated system. In addition, it is suggested to assess the small signal stability of new islands to evaluate their performance and give priority among different alternatives. Small signal stability study is introduced for each island to check the stability for the new islands. IEEE 33bus system is taken as a case study to ensure the effectiveness of the introduced methodology. The analysis is performed for a case study with optimal DG locations and sizes. NEPLAN software is used for dynamics and small signal stability investigations.\t10.5281/ZENODO.5816968\thttps://zenodo.org/record/5816968\thttps://zenodo.org/record/5816968\n",
