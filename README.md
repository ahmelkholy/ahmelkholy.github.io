"Iâ€™m Ahmed Elkholy, an assistant lecturer at the Electrical Power and Machines Engineering Department of the Faculty of Engineering at Tanta University. I have a B.Sc. and M.SC. degrees in Electrical Power and Machines Engineering from Tanta University and Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree at Moscow Power Engineering Institute.

My research interests include grid synchronization, distributed generators, adaptive phase-locked loop tuning system, and industrial electronics. I have published several papers in reputable journals and conferences on these topics. I enjoy teaching and mentoring students and sharing my knowledge and experience with them.

In my spare time, I like to read books, watch movies, play chess. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and meet new people. If you want to know more about me or my work, feel free to contact me anytime."
