I am an experienced Assistant Lecturer with a passion for education and a demonstrated history of working in the education management industry. I'm skilled in AutoCAD, Negotiation, English, Management, and Electrical Engineering, and am a strong education professional with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) focused in power systems from Tanta University.

Since July 2019, I have been an Assistant Lecturer at the Faculty of Engineering at Tanta University. In this role, I support the design, development, and production of learning and teaching material, deliver teaching programs with enthusiasm, and ensure efficient delivery of teaching programs. Prior to this, I was a Demonstrator at the Faculty of Engineering at Tanta University from March 2016 to July 2019. In this role, I assisted and provided guidance to students in practical exercises, maintained a safe environment, provided feedback on student performance, marked student tests using defined marking criteria where marking requires little or no interpretation, and ensured equipment and materials were prepared before the start of the session.

I am currently studying towards my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the National Research University ‚ÄúMoscow Power Engineering Institute‚Äù in Russia. I'm skilled in programming languages such as SQL and Python and am proficient in version control tools such as Git and Github.

In January 2021, I completed The Foreign Mission Envoys Training Program at National Training Academy in Cairo, Egypt. This program is introduced to the foreign mission envoys accepted to complete their PhD and Post-Doc studies abroad. It contains intensive courses (60h) on topics such as Communication and Presentation skills, Social Intelligence, Stress Management, Self-Branding, 2030 Egypt Vision, Etiquette and protocol, Economics Challenges Facing the Arab Republic of Egypt and National Security.

I am fluent in Arabic (Mother tongue), English and Russian.
